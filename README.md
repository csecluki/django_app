# django_app
Multifunctional app that I create to learn Django and basics of HTML, CSS &amp; JS

Web app allows visitors to create account, log in and view published articles on blog. There's also Task tab, where users can make their to do list.

User can add tasks to personal task manager, then he can show all his undone or all tasks and manage them - delete, update or change its status.
